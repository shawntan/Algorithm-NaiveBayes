Revision history for Perl extension Algorithm::NaiveBayes.

0.03

 - The double-loop inside the predict() method has been turned
   inside-out, so that the outer loop is now over the new attributes,
   rather than over the different labels in the training set.

 - Some internal changes for making customization easier: moved the
   model-creation code to new internal classes, making it easier to
   write additional classes that handle model-creation differently.

 - Moved some of the numerical utility functions to a
   Algorithm::NaiveBayes::Util module.

 - The do_purge() method was called during training regardless of
   whether the 'purge' flag was set.  This has been fixed.

 - original version; created by extracting the NaiveBayes code out of
   AI::Categorizer::Learner::NaiveBayes
